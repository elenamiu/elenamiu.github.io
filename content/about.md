Hi! :wave:

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Aarhus University in the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Studies, working on the [Play|Object|Play](https://play-object-play.au.dk/) project. Previously I have been a postdoc in the [BirthRites lab](https://www.eva.mpg.de/birthrites/) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and a postdoc in the [Ecco lab](https://www.eccolab.org/) in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University. I completed my PhD in the [Centre of Biological Diversity](https://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/biodiversity/) at the University of St Andrews. 

I am an interdisciplinary researcher interested in understanding human behaviour from an evolutionary perspective using *cultural evolution theory*. My research addresses broad questions about cultural adaptation, cultural change, and innovation across domains like technology, norms, language, and music. I take a multi-method approach and explore these questions using empirical and experimental frameworks with realistic large-scale datasets, theoretical modelling through agent-based simulations, as well as data-driven causal inference techniques using advanced statistical methods. 

Some of my current interests cosist of:
* [Theoretical](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/cultural-adaptation-is-maximised-when-intelligent-individuals-rarely-think-for-themselves/9C06326BEAB863A1F165C5E592F839BB) and [data-driven](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04494-0) investigations of the dynamics of [cumulative cultural evolution](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012436) and [innovation](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aaz0286)
* The role of children's play and children's learning for [cultural evolution and innovation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.28.645934.abstract)
* Applying causal inference methods to cross-sectional data to understand how [norms spread](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/5/pgaf113/8106611)
* [Analysing cross-cultural ethnographic data](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsif/article/21/221/20240673/90664/A-global-cross-cultural-analysis-of-string-figures) to understands patterns of cultural evolution 
* Age and innovation across domains
